# `rayman` -- Raylib Manpages

Raylib is notable for its 'documentation-by-example' style. This is an excellent way to
learn a thing, but when developing it is useful to have specific reference material.

This is a collection of manpages for raylib. I started writing them so I could quickly
check a reference via <S-k> from inside vim, without having to go to the browser. But
you could use it however you like.

## Installation

Clone the repo to your preferred loaction and fire off the `install` make target. You
may need administrator privileges. E.g.:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MichaelCromer/rayman.git
    cd rayman
    sudo make install
```

If you don't have `make`, or you want to install to a specific location, you can
manually `install` the docs by following along with the process in the Makefile.
